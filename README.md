Weather Analysis with R

This repository contains an analysis of weather data using R. The analysis covers various aspects of weather, including rainfall, humidity, temperature, and forecasting. Additionally, regression analysis using SPSS has been performed to gain further insights. Below are the key findings from this analysis:

Key Findings
Cairns is the Rainiest City
Cairns experiences the highest amount of rainfall among all the cities in Australia, making it the rainiest city in the dataset.
Linear Relationship Between Humidity and Temperature
A linear relationship was observed between humidity and temperature. A forecasting equation was generated using the linear regression method to predict temperature based on humidity.
82% Accuracy in Predicting Rain Tomorrow
A logistic regression model was built to predict whether there will be rain tomorrow or not, with humidity at 3 pm as a key predictor. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 82%, indicating its effectiveness in rain prediction.
Accurate Rainfall Forecasting with Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis was employed to forecast rainfall patterns. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Seasonal Naive methods demonstrated high accuracy in rainfall forecasting.
Regression Analysis Using SPSS
In addition to R, regression analysis was performed using SPSS to gain further insights into the relationships between various weather variables. Please refer to the SPSS analysis for detailed regression results and findings.
Cloud Cover and Humidity Impact on Rainfall
The analysis revealed a positive correlation between cloud cover and the likelihood of rainfall. Additionally, increased humidity was associated with a higher chance of rain.
Temperature's Inverse Relationship with Rainfall
There is an inverse relationship between temperature and the likelihood of rainfall. As temperature rises, the probability of rain decreases.
Gust Direction and Southern Regions
Most of the rainfall occurrences were associated with gust direction from southern regions, indicating that specific wind patterns influence rain patterns.
This combined analysis provides valuable insights into weather patterns and forecasting, enhancing our understanding of these complex relationships.
